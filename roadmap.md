TO-DO LIST:

BACKEND
✅ Add filters for licenses (solved 13th Oct)
✅ Implement search for multiple tags (solved 13th Oct) SWITCHED FROM TAGS TO TEXT. I THINK IT SHOWS BETTER RESULTS
✅ Improve search results ordering (solved 13th Oct)
✅ Implement multiple choice for sort (https://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photos.search.html) (solved 13th Oct)
✅ In case no search, show the most recent images (solved 13th Oct) 
✅ Show only recent images with license 7, 9 or 10 (solved 13th Oct)
✅ Implement safe_search filter (implemented 13th Oct but not working, probably due to un_auth app?)
✅ Deploy correctly to heroku
